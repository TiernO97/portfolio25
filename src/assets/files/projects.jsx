                <p>I worked on Cover in a click with one fellow developer. That developer done the majority of the work including the Get a Quote form, however I was tasked with developing the Renew Policy Form and Request Policy Change form. I also performed general maintanence throughout the site and fixed bugs!</p>
                <p>While developing the Renew Policy Form, I was introduced to global payments. This is an external API that returns a payment form when a successful request is made. I also was introduced to implementing Recaptcha and an Address lookup component as seen on many websites!</p>
                <p>I am really happy with the work I done on this site and feel that completing the above tasks helped improve my skills and increased my confidence where I to take up a similar project in the future whether it be as a part of a team or by myself.</p>

            <p>
                I was the only developer working on this project, I worked on both the React frontend and the NodeJS backend. The styling was done using Node Sass and flexbox was prominantly used across all components. This website involved quite 
                a number of forms across the client side and admin panel therefore redux forms was used to easily manage form values. All data was handled with Redux with any action functions containing API requests were made using fetch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite being comfortable using functional components with React hooks, this project was made with the majority of components being class based at the request of my employer. I also used <bold>connect</bold> from React Redux to connect
                my components to the reducers.

                <p>We styled all components using Node Sass and created each component individually and then compiled them together in their respective pages. Once that was complete we tackled the functionality like the forms and linked them to the admin panel via Node/Express/MongoDB.</p>

                <p>On this project I was the only developer working on it, I was in regular contact with the client to ensure any additions/changes were implemented to meet the clients desires. The client previously used Microsoft Excel to track keep log of this information so I implemented a file upload that would read an excel file, convert each row into JSON and upload it to the mongodb database.</p>
                <p>For this project I used Bootstrap for fundamental styling/page layout to structure where elements would go and to ensure responsiveness. I used tailwindCSS to style other components/elements in greater detail.</p>

                <p>This project had to be completed in a small time frame so comprised of 4 3/4 developers working on it. I myself was tasked at completing the "Resources" page and the "About" page.</p>
                <p>The resources page contained a selector to toggle between 3 different types of resources. Clicking this toggle button would refresh the list of resources, paginate them and also style each type uniquely. I created the toggle component seen in the image above and hooked it up to the redux store so that evrery time a user interacted with it, the selected value was saved in the gobal state.</p>
                <p>
                    The challenge was updating the list of resources when the store's "type" value had changed. In order to do this, I used the <strong>componentDidUpdate</strong> method and compared the current type with the previous one. If they differed then I would recall the function that fetched/paginated the resources by type. Using this method I achieved the desired functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also worked on the about page which was more straight forward. I primary used flexbox to layout the page and all it's different components. This ensured easy responsive behavior and as flexbox is primarily used in most projects at Digigrow it would benefitial to keep consistency.
